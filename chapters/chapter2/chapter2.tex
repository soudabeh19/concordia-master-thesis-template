\section{Selection Methods}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item what was our challenge to make us to provide different methods (sequential file generation in pipeline)
\item explain random-unreal and why we don't use it
\item cold start problem and how we conqure it (first row and a complete coloumn)
\item columns 
\item rows
\item random-real
\item random-diagonal (parameters)(refer to paper:...)
\item random-triangular-L (parameters)(refer to paper:...)
\item random-triangular-S (parameters)(refer to paper:...)
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Bias + Prediction}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item why you came up with considering Biases (huge constant portion in our utility matrix- some places were complete balck or white)
\item on which methods this technique is applied?
\item write the formula according to Netflix prize paper
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
