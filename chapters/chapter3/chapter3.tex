\chapter{Dataset}
% berif introduction of this chapter and what we are going to cover in this chapter 
% why we choosed this dataset (importance of reproducibility in neuroscience, huge files with long processing time)  
\section{HCP pipelines}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item explain HCP pipelines
\item what are subjects and their files 
\item what do we mean by differences (what do these differences reperesent? what kind of differences are they? how they identified?)
\item size of the dataset (\#subjects,\#files)
\item which pipeline of HCP we have used already
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Utility Matrix}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item what are item and user in our study (subjects,files)
\item what we mean by conditions (CentOS5, CentOS6, CentOS7)
\item check if I have to mention about CentOS6 built "?" 
\item number of differences in each condition pairs
\item what 1,0 reperesent in my binary utility matrix (with an example)
\item files are arranged by their modification time (get sure that files' sequence is identical for all subjects of the condition pair) 
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
